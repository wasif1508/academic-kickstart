I am a sophomre undergraduate majoring in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. 

I am broadly interested in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I have been working in the field of Bayesian Machine Learning for the past few months, and I was fascinated by the amount of underlying Mathematics governing it. I find this domain very interesting and plan to continue my work in it further. Besides I have worked on some exciting Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks in my sophomore year. I had a very brief exposure to Reinforcement Learning in my previous winters and hope to explore it rigorously sometime in future.
